# Mapping Earthquake Data with Leaflet

## Purpose
- The purpose of this project is to demonstrate skills using Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Leaflet. 
- By using the documentation from the Leaflet library, I created a logic file using Javascript to create a map and overlay earthquake data

## Project Overview
- Using the Leaflet library and Mapbox map styles, world maps were created and styled with multiple layers to choose from. 
- Using earthquake data, I created markers to showcase the location and magnitude of earthquakes over the past seven days. 
- Pop ups were also created so the user can click on each marker for a more detailed event of the earthquake, including location and specific magnitude. 
- A legend was also added to the bottom right of the screen, for clearer interpretation of the circle markers.

### Challenge Overview
- The challenge required me to add an additional overlay map of the tectonic plates to the existing map, where the user had the option to toggle on or off.
- The tectonic plate data was a geometry "linestring" object. 
- An additional element for the challenge was to add data for major earthquakes in the past 7 days (only earthquakes with a magnitude of 4.5 or higher). 
- The final piece to the challenge was to add an additional map layer style, which I chose to use the dark layer map. Now users will have three different options for map styles, plus the three overlay maps: earthquakes, tectonic plates, and major earthquakes.

## Results
- The results for my work are published on my Github pages site where users can access the data, find their specific ID number, and analyze the charts for bacteria found in their specific bodies.
